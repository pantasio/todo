1. Download and install the most recent VirtualBox for Windows from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Download and install the latest version of Vagrant from http://downloads.vagrantup.com. Windows users, download Vagrant.msi
3. So all I did was right-click on "My Computer"-->Properties-->Advanced System Settings-->Environment Variables. Here I scrolled down to find "VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH" and I changed it to "VBOX_INSTALL_PATH."
4. Run cmd as administrator
5. http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
6. http://railsinstaller.org/en
